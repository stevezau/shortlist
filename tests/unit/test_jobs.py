"""The durable job queue: claim, retry, recover, and stay out of a run's way.

Every maintenance action used to be a fire-and-forget executor call — no record, no retry, nowhere
an operator would see it fail. A disable cleanup lost to a Plex outage was never retried by anything,
because no run revisits a disabled user, so those rows stayed on Plex for ever.
